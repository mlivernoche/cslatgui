# cslatgui
GUI for [CSLAutomatedTestAPI](https://github.com/mlivernoche/CSLAutomatedTestAPI). Written in C# and WPF. Requires .NET Framwork 4.5 and CUDA 8.

This program allows you to pick the test parameters for each GPU, as well as defining multiple tests. These run the standard FP32 test. It also provides a tree view for browsing the results of the tests.
